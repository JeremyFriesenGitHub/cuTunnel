# cuTunnel

## Inspiration
As a first year student, navigating the Carleton tunnels can be difficult. To help students get to class on time, we decided to provide a tool that will make navigating the tunnels easier for first-year students.
## What it does
Allows students and faculty to find the shortest route from building A to building B using the Carleton tunnel system
## How we built it
We implemented an efficient pathfinding algorithm (Djikstra's algorithm) and graph theory concepts to calculate the most optimal tunnel route. We use the Cytoscope library for JavaScript to create a visual representation of the graph.
## Challenges we ran into
- Edge coloring issues with overlapping colors
- Getting accurate tunnel travel times
- Calculating the weight of the nodes
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating a project which implements graph theory
- Makes a real impact on the lives of students and faculty who use the tunnels often
## What we learned
- Resilience and adaptability
- Team collaboration
- Pivoting from one idea to the next
- Learning new technologies and languages
## What's next for CU Tunnels
- Survey users on tunnel commute times to provide more accurate commute time information
- Allow users to report issues with the tunnels
- Collaborate with Carleton University to promote the CU Tunnels web application
- Improve mobile compatibility
- Create a smart phone application or implement this tool within the Carleton Mobile app****
